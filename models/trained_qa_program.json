          "background": "Black holes are regions of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing can escape from them, not even light. Stephen Hawking proposed that black holes can emit radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon.",
          "reasoning": "According to quantum field theory in curved spacetime, vacuum fluctuations near the event horizon can result in particle-antiparticle pairs. When this happens near the event horizon, one particle may fall in while the other escapes, appearing as radiation. From an outside observer's perspective, it appears that the black hole is emitting radiation. Over time, this process leads to the black hole losing mass and eventually evaporating.",
          "answer": "Black holes emit Hawking radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon where particle-antiparticle pairs can be separated, with one falling into the black hole and the other escaping as radiation.",

          "background": "CRISPR-Cas9 is a revolutionary gene editing technology adapted from a naturally occurring genome editing system in bacteria. The bacteria capture snippets of DNA from invading viruses and use them to create DNA segments known as CRISPR arrays, which allow the bacteria to remember the viruses.",
          "reasoning": "The CRISPR-Cas9 system works in three steps: (1) A guide RNA (gRNA) is designed to match the DNA sequence to be edited. (2) The gRNA binds to the Cas9 enzyme, forming a complex. (3) This complex locates and binds to the target DNA sequence. The Cas9 enzyme then cuts both strands of DNA at the targeted location. The cell's natural DNA repair mechanisms then repair the cut, either by non-homologous end joining (which can result in gene knockout) or by homology-directed repair if a template is provided (allowing for precise genetic modifications).",
          "answer": "CRISPR-Cas9 is a gene editing mechanism where a guide RNA directs the Cas9 enzyme to cut DNA at a specific target sequence, after which cellular repair mechanisms can either knock out genes or introduce specific modifications when a repair template is provided.",
